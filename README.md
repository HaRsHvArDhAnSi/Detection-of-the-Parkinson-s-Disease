# Detection-of-the-Parkinson-s-Disease
Detection of Parkinson’s Disease using Python 🧠🔍  
🌟 Golden Project 1 by Code Clause 🌟
This repository contains a Python implementation for detecting Parkinson's disease using machine learning techniques. The project aims to build a classifier that can accurately identify the presence of Parkinson's disease based on a dataset of various features related to the disease.

📊 The project includes the following steps:

1️⃣ Data Loading: The Parkinson's Disease dataset is loaded using Pandas library.

2️⃣ Data Preprocessing: The dataset is prepared by extracting features and labels. The features are scaled using MinMaxScaler for better model performance.

3️⃣ Model Training: A Random Forest classifier is trained using the preprocessed data. The classifier learns patterns from the features to make accurate predictions.

4️⃣ Model Evaluation: The accuracy of the model is measured using accuracy_score. Additionally, a confusion matrix is generated to evaluate the performance of the classifier.

📈 Visualization: The project includes a visualization step using Matplotlib. A scatter plot is created to display the 'MDVP:Fo(Hz)' feature, where each data point is colored based on the predicted status.

The Jupyter Notebook in this repository provides a detailed walkthrough of the entire process. Feel free to explore the code and learn more about the detection of Parkinson's disease using machine learning!
